# Tuwi - A terminal UI framework for C

## What is Tuwi?

Tuwi is a terminal user interface framework written in the C programming language, developed by [ShogAI](https://shog.ai) for use in the Shoggoth project.

Tuwi is the framework used for implementing the terminal user interface of Shoggoth, Camel, and other Shoggoth projects.

### ⚠️Disclaimer⚠️
This library is still early in development and should be considered unstable and experimental.

This documentation is a work in progress. It is not complete and may contain invalid information as Tuwi is rapidly evolving.

## EXAMPLES

Examples can be found in /examples

You can run examples with:
```bash
$ E=<example_name> make run-example
```

where <example_name> is the name of the example you want to run. For example:

```bash
$ E=simple make run-example
```

## BUILDING TUWI

### Supported platforms

Tuwi currently supports only Linux and macOS operating systems.

$ git clone https://github.com/shog-ai/tuwi
```
